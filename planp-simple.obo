comment: We use the has_part relation to relate complex qualities to more primitive ones. A complex quality is a collection of qualities. The complex quality cannot exist without the sub-qualities. For example, the quality 'swollen' necessarily comes with the qualities of 'protruding' and 'increased size'.
