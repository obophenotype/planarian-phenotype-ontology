comment: Note that this term should not be used for direct annotation. If you are trying to make an annotation to x phase, it is likely that the correct annotation is 'regulation of x/y phase transition' or to a process which occurs during the reported phase (i.e mitotic DNA replication for mitotic S-phase). To capture the phase when a specific location or process is observed, the phase term can be used in an annotation extension (PMID:24885854) applied to a cellular component term (with the relation exists_during) or a biological process term (with the relation happens_during).

The acid chemical may be in gaseous, liquid or solid form." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:rn, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid]
comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if an organism were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the organism is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC.

comment: Note that we deem eukaryotic cilia and microtubule-based flagella to be equivalent, while the bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella have a different structure. The former are microtubule-based structures that lash back and forth and are present only in eukaryotes, while the latter achieve motility by rotation. Bacterial- and archaeal-type flagella are superficially similar but have a different molecular composition and fine structure. These three structures never co-exist in the same organism. Therefore, GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term. Direct annotations to GO:0001539 'cilium or flagellum-dependent cell motility' may be amended during annotation QC.

name: adaptive immune response based on somatic recombination of immune receptors built from immunoglobulin superfamily domains
namespace: biological_process
def: "An immune response mediated by lymphocytes expressing specific receptors for antigen produced through a somatic diversification process that includes somatic recombination of germline gene segments encoding immunoglobulin superfamily domains. Recombined receptors for antigen encoded by immunoglobulin superfamily domains include T cell receptors and immunoglobulins (antibodies) produced by B cells. The first encounter with antigen elicits a primary immune response that is slow and not of great magnitude. T and B cells selected by antigen become activated and undergo clonal expansion. A fraction of antigen-reactive T and B cells become memory cells, whereas others differentiate into effector cells. The memory cells generated during the primary response enable a much faster and stronger secondary immune response upon subsequent exposures to the same antigen (immunological memory). An example of this is the adaptive immune response found in Mus musculus." [GOC:add, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0781735149, ISBN:1405196831]

def: "A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs. These actions are described from two distinct but related perspectives: (1) biochemical activity, and (2) role as a component in a larger system/process." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code "no data" (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

def: "The rough (or granular) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has ribosomes adhering to the outer surface; the ribosomes are the site of translation of the mRNA for those proteins which are either to be retained within the cisternae (ER-resident proteins), the proteins of the lysosomes, or the proteins destined for export from the cell. Glycoproteins undergo their initial glycosylation within the cisternae." [ISBN:0198506732]

name: Golgi apparatus
namespace: cellular_component
def: "A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions." [ISBN:0198506732]
comment: Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.

comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent. In most eukaryotic species, intracellular sub-components of the cilium, such as the ciliary base and rootlet, are located near the plasma membrane. In Diplomonads such as Giardia, instead, the same ciliary parts are located further intracellularly. Also, 'cilium' may be used when axonemal structure and/or motility are unknown, or when axonemal structure is unusual. For all other cases, please refer to children of 'cilium'. Finally, note that any role of ciliary proteins in sensory events should be captured by annotating to relevant biological process terms.

Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

def: "A series of molecular signals that proceeds with an activated receptor promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha-subunit of an associated heterotrimeric G-protein complex. The GTP-bound activated alpha-G-protein then dissociates from the beta- and gamma-subunits to further transmit the signal within the cell. The pathway begins with receptor-ligand interaction, or for basal GPCR signaling the pathway begins with the receptor activating its G protein in the absence of an agonist, and ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. transcription.  The pathway can start from the plasma membrane, Golgi or nuclear membrane." [GOC:bf, GOC:mah, PMID:16902576, PMID:24568158, Wikipedia:G_protein-coupled_receptor]

def: "A biological process represents a specific objective that the organism is genetically programmed to achieve. Biological processes are often described by their outcome or ending state, e.g., the biological process of cell division results in the creation of two daughter cells (a divided cell) from a single parent cell. A biological process is accomplished by a particular set of molecular functions carried out by specific gene products (or macromolecular complexes), often in a highly regulated manner and in a particular temporal sequence." [GOC:pdt]
def: "Any process specifically pertinent to the functioning of integrated living units: cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. A process is a collection of molecular events with a defined beginning and end." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:isa_complete]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code "no data" (ND), is used to indicate this.

name: cell death
namespace: biological_process
def: "Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538)." [GOC:mah, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, PMID:25236395]
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide) show that cell death has occurred, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed). When information is provided on the cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process'). Also, if experimental data suggest that a gene product influences cell death indirectly, rather than being involved in the death process directly, consider annotating to a 'regulation' term.

def: "A membranous cellular structure that bears the photosynthetic pigments in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. In cyanobacteria thylakoids are of various shapes and are attached to, or continuous with, the plasma membrane. In eukaryotes they are flattened, membrane-bounded disk-like structures located in the chloroplasts; in the chloroplasts of higher plants the thylakoids form dense stacks called grana. Isolated thylakoid preparations can carry out photosynthetic electron transport and the associated phosphorylation." [GOC:ds, GOC:mtg_sensu, ISBN:0198506732]
comment: A thylakoid is not considered an organelle, but some thylakoids are part of organelles.

Red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength of 580-700nm. Far red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 700-800nm. An example of this response is seen at the beginning of many plant species developmental stages. These include germination, and the point when cotyledon expansion is triggered. In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs."

Gene expression is the process in which a gene's coding sequence is converted into a mature gene product or products (proteins or RNA). This includes the production of an RNA transcript as well as any processing to produce a mature RNA product or an mRNA or circRNA (for protein-coding genes) and the translation of that mRNA or circRNA into protein. Protein maturation is included when required to form an active form of a product from an inactive precursor form." [GOC:dph, GOC:tb]

comment: This term covers any process that negatively regulates the rate of production of a mature gene product, and so includes processes that negatively regulate that rate by reducing the level, stability or availability of intermediates in the process of gene expression. For example, it covers any process that reduces the level, stability or availability of mRNA or circRNA for translation and thereby reduces the rate of production of the encoded protein via translation.

def: "A process which begins when a cell receives an internal or external signal and activates a series of biochemical events (signaling pathway). The process ends with the death of the cell." [GOC:lr, GOC:mtg_apoptosis]
comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children.

alt_id: GO:0034262
def: "The major inducible pathway for the general turnover of cytoplasmic constituents in eukaryotic cells, it is also responsible for the degradation of active cytoplasmic enzymes and organelles during nutrient starvation. Macroautophagy involves the formation of double-membrane-bounded autophagosomes which enclose the cytoplasmic constituent targeted for degradation in a membrane-bounded structure.  Autophagosomes then fuse with a lysosome (or vacuole) releasing single-membrane-bounded autophagic bodies that are then degraded within the lysosome (or vacuole). Some types of macroautophagy, e.g. pexophagy, mitophagy, involve selective targeting of the targets to be degraded." [PMID:11099404, PMID:12914914, PMID:15798367, PMID:16973210, PMID:20159618, PMID:9412464]
comment: Targeted macroautophagy sometimes targets regions of cytoplasm containing non-self, such as virus particles or components (e.g. see PMID:20159618).  As this is essentially the same process as macroautophagy that encloses and digests only self, the term autophagy is still used despite the enclosure of some non-self (non-auto) entities.

def: "The process in which double-stranded RNAs silence cognate genes. Involves posttranscriptional gene inactivation ('silencing') both of transgenes or dsRNA introduced into a germline, and of the host gene(s) homologous to the transgenes or dsRNA. This silencing is triggered by the introduction of transgenes or double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and can occur through a specific decrease in the level of mRNA, or by negative regulation of translation, of both host genes and transgenes." [GOC:ems, PMID:11201747, PMID:11713190, PMID:18771919]
comment: Note that this term refers specifically to posttranscriptional mechanisms by which small interfering RNAs down-regulate gene expression. Also consider annotating to other descendants of 'gene silencing by RNA ; GO:0031047'.

name: sexual reproduction
namespace: biological_process
def: "A reproduction process that creates a new organism by combining the genetic material of two gametes, which may come from two organisms or from a single organism, in the case of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites, e.g. C. elegans, or self-fertilization in plants. It occurs both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes: in multicellular eukaryotic organisms, an individual is created anew; in prokaryotes, the initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) originating from two gametes join up so that homologous sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. After the new recombinant chromosome is formed, it is passed on to progeny." [GOC:jl, GOC:kmv, GOC:krc, GOC:tb, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction, ISBN:0387520546]
comment: Sexual reproduction may be seen as the regular alternation, in the life cycle of haplontic, diplontic and diplohaplontic organisms, of meiosis and fertilization which provides for the production offspring. In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times.

def: "A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together." [GOC:dos, GOC:mah]
comment: A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

def: "A process carried out by gene products in an organism that enable the organism to engage in a symbiotic relationship, a more or less intimate association, with another organism. The various forms of symbiosis include parasitism, in which the association is disadvantageous or destructive to one of the organisms; mutualism, in which the association is advantageous, or often necessary to one or both and not harmful to either; and commensalism, in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected. However, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism. In fact, the direction of a symbiotic interaction can change during the lifetime of the symbionts due to developmental changes as well as changes in the biotic/abiotic environment in which the interaction occurs. Microscopic symbionts are often referred to as endosymbionts." [GOC:cc, https://study.com/academy/lesson/symbiont-definition-lesson-quiz.html]

In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic nerve ending secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

name: autophagic cell death
namespace: biological_process
def: "A form of programmed cell death that is accompanied by the formation of autophagosomes. Autophagic cell death is characterized by lack of chromatin condensation and massive vacuolization of the cytoplasm, with little or no uptake by phagocytic cells." [GOC:autophagy, GOC:mah, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, PMID:18846107, PMID:23347517]
comment: The precise nature of autophagic cell death is still being debated, and the link between autophagy and cell death unclear. As autophagy is often induced under conditions of stress that could also lead to cell death, there has been a propagation of the idea that autophagy can act as a cell death mechanism; but others suggest that autophagy may simply be an attempt of dying cells to adapt to lethal stress rather than a mechanism to execute a cell death program. Further studies are required to resolve this controversy (see e.g. PMID:22082964, PMID:22052193, PMID:25236395). In the meantime, curators should carefully examine the experimental evidence presented in papers concerning autophagic cell death, and annotate accordingly. Recently, an instance of autophagic cell death, termed autosis, was discovered that relies on the plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase. Autosis was observed in vivo in the brain of rats subjected to an ischemic insult. It's still unclear if all cases of autophagic cell death require the Na+/K+-ATPase or not.

def: "The developmental process pertaining to the initial formation of an anatomical structure from unspecified parts.

An anatomical structure is any biological entity that occupies space and is distinguished from its surroundings. Anatomical structures can be macroscopic such as a carpel, or microscopic such as an acrosome." [GOC:dph, GOC:jid, GOC:tb]
comment: Note that, for example, the formation of a pseudopod in an amoeba would not be considered formation involved in morphogenesis because it would not be thought of as the formation of an anatomical structure that was part of the shaping of the amoeba during its development. The formation of an axon from a neuron would be considered the formation of an anatomical structure involved in morphogenesis because it contributes to the creation of the form of the neuron in a developmental sense.

comment: Transmembrane transport is the transport of a solute across a lipid bilayer. Note that transport through the nuclear pore complex is not transmembrane because the nuclear membrane is a double membrane and is not traversed. For transport through the nuclear pore, consider instead the term 'nucleocytoplasmic transport ; GO:0006913' and its children. Note also that this term is not intended for use in annotating lateral movement within membranes.

Also, researchers consider the composition of both the plasm and the membrane of the cilium to be detectably different from that in the non-ciliary cytosol and plasma membrane (e.g. in terms of calcium ion concentration, membrane lipid composition, and more). For this reason, the term "ciliary plasm" is not linked to "cytoplasm".

comment: This term can be used to annotate gene products involved in apoptotic events happening downstream of the cross-talk point between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The cross-talk starts when caspase-8 cleaves Bid and truncated Bid interacts with mitochondria. From this point on it is not possible to distinguish between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

name: ciliary basal body-plasma membrane docking

def: "The docking of a cytosolic centriole/basal body to the plasma membrane via the ciliary transition fibers. In some species this may happen via an intermediate step, by first docking to the ciliary vesicle via the ciliary transition fibers. The basal body-ciliary vesicle then relocates to the plasma membrane, followed by the ciliary vesicle fusing with the plasma membrane, effectively attaching the basal body to the plasma membrane." [GOC:cilia, PMID:13978319, PMID:23348840, PMID:23530209, PMID:25686250, PMID:26981235, Reactome:R-HSA-5620912.1]
comment: Basal bodies in jawed vertebrates appear to first attach to a ciliary vesicle. It is unclear how specific this is to jawed vertebrates or if other organisms also employ this sequence. Some species like Giardia intestinalis do not relocate their basal bodies to the plasma membrane, but have their axonemes extend through the cytosol to then protrude out of the cell to form flagella.

comment: Relational qualities are qualities that hold between multiple entities. Normal (monadic) qualities such as the shape of a eyeball exist purely as a quality of that eyeball. A relational quality such as sensitivity to light is a quality of that eyeball (and connecting nervous system) as it relates to incoming light waves/particles.

def: "A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions."

comment: Except in the case of abstracted fiat boundaries such as the midline plane of an organism, all 2D anatomical entities have a 3 dimensional projection. For example, the surface of the shell of a muscle has a distinct shape that projects into the third dimension. Note that boundaries are 2D structures. They have no thickness - and so can not be sites of gene expression or gene product localisation. For this, use boundary region terms.

property_value: editor_note "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string

Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.
