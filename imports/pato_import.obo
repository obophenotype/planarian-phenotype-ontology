comment: Example: [E=organism Q=lacks_all_parts_of_type E2=Wing] - applies to an organism. A relational quality in which the bearer entity has no parts of the specified type. The bearer of this quality has_part = 0 of the indicated entity type, where a comparable organism usually has at least 1 part of the same type. Note that the bearer of the quality is the whole, not the part. Formally: If a bearer entity e lacks all parts of type X at time t, then there exists no instances x of X at t such that x part_of e that has no wings, where wings are normally present in that organism type. In OWL this is equivalent to a restriction on the OBO_REL:has_part relation with cardinality=0, i.e has_part 0 E2.

def: "Q1 has_part Q2 if and only if: every instance of Q1 is a quality_of an entity that has_quality some Q2." [PATOC:CJM]
comment: We use the has_part relation to relate complex qualities to more primitive ones. A complex quality is a collection of qualities. The complex quality cannot exist without the sub-qualities. For example, the quality 'swollen' necessarily comes with the qualities of 'protruding' and 'increased size'.

def: "q1 increased_in_magnitude_relative_to q2 if and only if magnitude(q1) > magnitude(q2). Here, magnitude(q) is a function that maps a quality to a unit-invariant scale." [PATOC:CJM]
comment: This relation is used to determine the 'directionality' of relative qualities such as 'increased strength', relative to the parent type, 'strength'.
