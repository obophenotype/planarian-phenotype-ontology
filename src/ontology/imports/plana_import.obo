comment: Depicted by field contains a diagram representing the protonephrida unit (top) as well as a 3D rendering of confocal data depicting the same. In the diagram, terminal flame cells and their corresponding cilia are in blues, the proximal tubule is in reds, the distal tubule is in greens while the  collecting duct is in purple. In the 3D rendering below the cilia (AcTub) are in blue, portions of the proximal tubule (slc6a-13) are in red while the distal tubule (slc6a-12) is in green.

comment: Depicted by field contains a diagram representing the protonephrida unit (top) as well as a 3D rendering of confocal data depicting the same. In the diagram, terminal flame cells and their corresponding cilia are in blues, the proximal tubule is in reds, the distal tubule is in greens while the  collecting duct is in purple. In the 3D rendering below the cilia (AcTub) are in blue, portions of the proximal tubule (slc6a-13) are in red while the distal tubule (slc6a-12) is in green.

It usually consists of cerebral ganglia anteriorly with the nerve cords running down the ventral ('belly', as opposed to back) plane of the organism. This characteristic is important in qualifying the difference compared to the chordates, which have a dorsal nerve cord. Ventral nerve cords from anterior to posterior (the thoracic and abdominal tagma in the arthropods) are made up of segmented ganglia that are connected by a tract of nerve fibers passing from one side to the other of the nerve cord called commissures. The complete system bears some likeness to a rope ladder. In some animals the bilateral ganglia are fused into a single large ganglion per segment. This characteristic is found mostly in the insects." xsd:string

In the diagram, terminal flame cells and their corresponding cilia are in blues, the proximal tubule is in reds, the distal tubule is in greens while the  collecting duct is in purple. In the 3D rendering below the cilia (AcTub) are in blue, portions of the proximal tubule (slc6a-13) are in red while the distal tubule (slc6a-12) is in green.

This review will attempt to consider the key features of such diversity of chiasmatic organisation in vertebrates and the mechanisms that sculpt them from the limited literature that is available. However, as so much research has been undertaken on the structure and development of the chiasm in laboratory animals, any review must consider the information that has been gleaned from them and hope that future studies will determine whether the features revealed in these animals, and the underlying mechanisms that generate them, have a common vertebrate plan.[uncertain][VHOG]" xsd:string

In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions."
